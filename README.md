# *The Rufier test* is a test method used to assess the functional state of the cardiovascular system. This test cannot be used as a diagnostic method.
**The Roufier test.** In a subject who is lying on his back for 5 minutes, the number of pulsations for 15 seconds (P1) is determined; then, for 45 seconds, the subject performs 30 squats. After the end of the load, the subject lies down, and the number of pulsations for the first 15 seconds (P2) is counted again, and then for the last 15 from the first minute of the recovery period (P3). The assessment of the heart's performance is made according to the formula:

**Rufier index** = (4*(p1+p2+p3)-200)/10
